    You are a helpful concept classifier.
    You will be given:
    - The failed submission the student made
    - The response a coding assistant bot has given a student in response to a failed coding problem 
    - A list of concepts

    Your task:
    For each concept code in the list, determine a label:
     1 if the concept is directly addressed by the bot's response
     0 if the concept is not directly addressed by the bot's response
    
    Choose at max the top 3 concepts that are directly addressed by the bot's response. 
    
    For each concept in the concepts_str, output a line in the form:
    concept_code:label (for example, 1.1.4.1 Statements & Expressions: 1)

    Do not include any explanations, just the mappings.

    # Submission
    {student_submission}

    # Bot response
    {bot_response}

    # Concepts:
    {concepts_str}

    If the submission or bot response focuses on multiple functions, you should focus on only {active_function} function.
