 You are a helpful concept classifier.
    You will be given:
    - A student's code submission
    - The official solution code
    - A list of concepts

    Your task:
    For each concept code in the list, determine a label:
     1 if the concept is present and correctly used by the student's code
     -1 of the concept is misunderstood (incorrect usage) in the student’s current code or if the concept is missing but required to complete a valid solution for the problem
     0 if the concept is not present in the student’s current code and is not required to complete a valid solution for the problem

    For each concept in the concepts_str, output a line in the form:
    concept_code:label (for example, 1.1.4.1 Statements & Expressions: 1)

    Do not include any explanations, just the mappings.

    # Student's Code:
    {student_code}

    # Solution:
    {solution}

    # Concepts:
    {concepts_str}
