 You are a helpful concept classifier.
    You will be given:
    - A student's code submission
    - The official solution code
    - A concept
    - A description of the concept, as defined in the textbook

    Your task:
    Determine a label for the concept:
     1 if the concept is present and correctly used by the student's code
     -1 of the concept is misunderstood (incorrect usage) in the student’s current code or if the concept is missing but required to complete a valid solution for the problem
     0 if the concept is not present in the student’s current code and is not required to complete a valid solution for the problem

    Output only the number of your choice.

    # Student's Code:
    {student_code}

    # Solution:
    {solution}

    # Concept:
    {concept_str}

    # Mapped Textbook Content
    {mapped_textbook_content}
